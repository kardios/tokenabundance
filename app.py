default_prompt = """Instructions: Analyze the situation (historical event, company, policy, or system) using the following structured approach. Answer each section clearly and concisely.

1. Coordination Stack Analysis
Break down the system into four dimensions:
- Information: How knowledge, signals, and attention flow. Are there bottlenecks, feedback loops, or superior intelligence?
- Economic: How value, incentives, and resources are distributed. Who benefits? Are incentives aligned or misaligned?
- Institutional: How rules, hierarchies, and power structures shape action. Are institutions flexible or rigid?
- Cognitive: How beliefs, legitimacy, and perception evolve. How does psychology affect behavior and outcomes?
Output Example: 2‚Äì4 sentences per dimension, highlighting the key structural drivers.

2. Zero to One Insights
Identify 2‚Äì3 counterintuitive, underappreciated, or hidden truths implied by the situation. These should:
- Challenge conventional assumptions
- Reveal drivers of change that are not obvious
- Highlight leverage opportunities
Output Example: 1‚Äì2 sentences per insight.

3. Leverage Points
For each insight, identify specific points of intervention in the system where small changes could produce outsized effects. Consider:
- Rules and constraints
- Information flows
- Incentives
- Feedback loops
- Perceptions and beliefs
Output Example: 1‚Äì3 concrete interventions per insight, phrased as actionable moves.

4. Strategic Implications
Synthesize the above into clear, actionable strategy recommendations for a leader, policymaker, or creator. Include:
- Opportunities for competitive advantage or system improvement
- How to align incentives, information, and beliefs for maximum effect
- High-impact moves rather than general observations
Output Example: 3‚Äì5 bullet points of concise, actionable advice.

Tips for Use: Keep language simple and clear; explain complex ideas plainly. Focus on causality, not just description. Always highlight where small interventions have outsized impact."""
